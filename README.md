# Burger

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.


MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM following MVC design. Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, Handlebars to generate HTML. Deployed on Heroku at https://burger-0513.herokuapp.com/
